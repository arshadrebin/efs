### Elastic File System

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a scalable and fully managed file storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to provide shared file storage for multiple Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files with no need for management or provisioning.

EFS is built using the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol, which allows it to provide a simple and familiar file system interface to EC2 instances. It supports the standard file system operations such as create, read, write, and delete, and allows multiple EC2 instances to concurrently access the same file system.
